## 📖 Overview

This project explores the **CORD-19 metadata dataset** — a collection of academic papers related to COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. The goal is to:

- Load and clean real-world research metadata
- Analyze publication trends over time
- Identify top publishing journals
- Visualize frequent terms in paper titles
- Build an interactive dashboard with **Streamlit**

Perfect for learning data cleaning, visualization, and dashboarding in Python!
